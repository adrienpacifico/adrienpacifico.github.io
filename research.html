        <h5>Research question: </h5>
        We want to know how rich households reacted, on their taxable income margin, to a tax reform that induced, for some households a lump sum increase in their tax liability, or a lump sum increase and a change in marginal tax rate for other households.<br>
         I rely on the French joint income tax that applies different schemes based on family composition as an additional source of variation.  It allows me to do a triple difference estimation of the reform.

        <h5>Context: </h5>
        <ul>
          <li>The French tax system works such that the <i>child tax break </i> is increasing with income.
          </li>
          <li>
            However, the fiscal gain a household can derive from a child is bounded by a ceiling.
          </li>
          <li>
          The ceiling per child has been lowered from 2336€ to 1500€ between 2011 and 2014. That per child ceiling is twice the baseline amount for the third child and over. 
          </li>
          <li>
          Households have been affected in three ways: 
            <ol>
              <li>
                Households for which the fiscal advantage per child was lower than 1500 euros are unaffected.
              </li>
              <li>
                Households for which the fiscal advantage per child was between 1500 euros and 2336 euros face a change in their marginal tax rate.
              </li>
              <li>
                Households for which the fiscal advantage per child was over 2336 euros face a lump sum loss in disposable income of 836€ per child.
              </li>
            </ol>

          </li>
        </ul>
        <h5>The idea: </h5>
          <ol>
          <li>
            Households below the ceiling are not impacted by the reform and can be a control group.
          </li>
          <li>
            Households between 2011 and 2014 ceilings will be subject to an <b>income and a substitution effect</b>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Households that are over the ceiling, since they incur a lump sum loss (without any change of their marginal tax rate) are thus subject to a <b>pure income effect</b>.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h5>Implications: </h5>
          As the fiscal advantage increases with income, there exists an income threshold at which a household will attain the ceiling. <br>
          The graph above shows the fiscal tax break due to children for a married couple from one to three children before and after the reform.

        <h5>Data: </h5>
         I use the Échantillon Démographique Permanent (EDP). The EDP allows to follow a panel of 2 million households over 5 years with their tax returns. It also contains a rich set of other variables such as diplomas, housing characteristics, that allows to include a rich set of controls to the analysis.
        <h5>The method: </h5>

        As emphasized by <a href= "http://piketty.pse.ens.fr/fichiers/public/Piketty1999f.pdf" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="right" title="L'immense avantage du mécanisme français du QF,
unique en son genre parmi les grands pays
développés, est qu'il permet d'identifier des
''groupes de contrôle'' relativement fiables, sous la
forme de groupes de contribuables dont le niveau de
revenu imposable est exactement le même que ceux
du ''groupe test'', mais qui ne sont pas,concernés par
les mêmes variations de taux marginaux
d'imposition, du fait d'un nombre de parts de QF
différent de celui du ''groupe test''. ">Piketty(1998)</a>, the family quotient mechanism embodies in itself a <u>triple difference estimator</u>. As the condition to be treated is conditionnal to be on a specific position of the income distribution for a given number of children, we can run a triple difference estimator: 

      <p>$$\begin{align*}
\Delta y_i &= \beta_0 + \sum_{i=1}^{6} {\beta_i \text{Children}_i} + \sum_{j=1}^{6} {{}_{b}\delta_i \text{Between}_i}  + \sum_{i=1}^{6} {{}_{o}\delta_i \text{Over}_j} \\
    &+ \sum_{i=1}^6 {{}_{b}\gamma_{i} \text{Children}_i \times \text{Between}_i} \\
    &+ \sum_{i=1}^6 {{}_{o}\gamma_{i} \text{Children}_i \times \text{Over}_i} \\
    & + \epsilon_i
\end{align*}$$ </p>
        <p> \(\Delta y_i \), the endogenous variable, is the change in taxable income before the reform (in 2011) and after the reform (in 2014).
        </p>

        <p> \(Over_i\) is the dummy indicator for being over the income threshold where the fiscal advantage is saturating the 2011 ceiling constraint per i children (e.g 6777 euros for 1 child families). \(Between_i\) the one for being between 2011 and 2013 thresholds. \(\text{Children}_i\) the dummy indicator for i number of children. </p>

        <p>Under the classical assumption underlying the classical diff-in-diff literature, \(\beta_0\) captures the general trend in the population, \( \beta_i \) the average difference in trend based on the number of children in the household, \( {}_{b}\delta_i \) and \( {}_{o}\delta_i \) captures the effect of being between or over the tresholds.   </p>

        <h5>Results: </h5>
        <p> We find evidence of large income effect on that population, contrary to cross-sectional analysis of elasticities, or to income tax reforms that concern the top 1% of the income distribution. It is very likely that these large income effects are due to habits formation, meaning that households do not accept to diminish their standards of living by compensating the income loss associated with the tax reform by working more. Those results are preliminary.</p>

        <h5>Research question: </h5>
        We want to test the Pareto efficiency assumption made in collective households models by relying on a natural experiment that concerns cohabiting couples with children. Those couples have to choose to which tax-unit to allocate their children. Some allocation leads to a higher income tax than others, and households that do not select the allocation that leads to the smallest income tax are not respecting the Pareto efficiency assumption.  We document the number of households that do not have efficient behaviors, then we try to investigate sources of these inefficiencies by investigating different pathways.

        <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-4by3">
        <iframe class="embed-responsive-item"  src="./Notebooks/cohabitants-heatmap.html"></iframe>
        </div>
        <p>
        <b> The setting: </b>
        <ul>
          <li>Cohabitants living in France under the same household constitute two fiscal units. 
          </li>
          <li>In the presence of children in the household, they can allocate each non-stepchild to one of the two tax units.<br>
          For example, a family of two cohabitants and two children, there exists three allocations: both children on the mother tax return, one child on each cohabitant tax return, and both children on the father tax return.
          </li>
          <li>
          Putting a child on a tax return leads to a tax break that is dependent of the taxpayer income.
          Depending on the mother and father income, each allocation will lead to a defined income tax liability.
          </li>
        </ul>

        The graph above, made to represent a family with two children, provide for each cohabitant income combination and each allocation, the associated income tax for the year 2013. The color grading represents the difference between the best and the worst allocation. Allocation A corresponds to all the children put on the father, B the equal split, and C all on the mother.
        </p>
        <p>
        <b> The idea: </b>
        The assumption usually made over households is that they respect efficiency. Cohabitants with children should thus choose the allocation that minimizes their tax liability. The choice of allocation is a quasi-experimental framework that allows doing a simple test of efficiency within the household.
        </p>
        <p>
        <b> Results: </b>
        We use a big administrative dataset (EDP) which allows us to compute the income tax of each cohabitant, but also eliminate stepfamilies from the sample (with civil registry databases). After computing the tax of each allocation an household can have, we compare the allocation leading to the smallest tax liability to the chosen one. We show that over 25% of the households do not respect the Pareto efficiency by choosing an allocation that is not optimal.</p>
        <p>
        We then investigate several avenues to explain why some couples are inefficient.

         <ul> 


        <p>
         <li> <b>Social Norm</b>: We show that couples are biased, as a part of the allocation errors result to the fact that households tend to allocate more children to the father.</li>
        </p>        
        <p>
         <li> <b>Inertia</b>: While 20% of the households change their allocation from one year to another to minimize their tax liability, 80% of the households that should have changed their allocation did not by sticking to their previous year allocation. About 8% of the households "learn" the tax scheme by changing their allocation for the optimal one. Pure confusion (or erratic choice) only account for about 2% of the non-optimisation behavior.  </li>
        </p>

         <li> <p> <b>Cooperation</b>: Couples to optimize need to cooperate. They have to share their exact income, compute the income tax of each allocation, then probably bargain for a cash transfer from the cohabitant taking the most children to the one taking the less.</p>
          <p> We make the assumption that cooperating couples tend to marry or engage in a civil union more, and that non-cooperating couples tend to separate. </p>
          <p> We then test the cooperation assumption by running a multinomial logit regression on the change in the marital status over whether or not the allocation chosen is the optimal one. We show that not optimizing with an income loss that is greater than 1% of the household income implies a greater probability to separate while optimizing increase the probability to get married or to contract a civil union (PACS). </p>

        <h2>Tax frequency
            <a href="#tax_frequency"></a>
        </h2> 
        (with O. Bargain and Alain Trannoy)
        <h5>Research question: </h5>
        <p>
            In this article, we explore the temporality of the tax by comparing a tax system with an income tax computed on an annual basis but paid monthly (one-twelfth each month), to a tax computed on a monthly basis and paid monthly.
          </p>

        <img class="img-responsive" src="docs/tax_frequency_graph.png" alt="graph tax-frequency" id="image_me">



        <p>Formally we compare:

          <ul compact>
            <li>the first system where the tax paid at a given month \(t \) is \(\frac{G(\sum_{1}^{12}y_{t})}{12}\),
             </li>
            <li>to one where the tax paid at a given month \(t \) is \( \frac{G(12 y_{t})}{12} \).
             </li>
          </ul> 
          With \(G()\) a general tax function, an \(y_t\) the tax-unit income for a given month \(t\).

         

        </p>




        <p>The question of the frequency of the tax is of little interest if streams of income are steady. The monthly tax streams would be the same between the two tax systems. <br>


        However, if they vary, in the presence of a convex tax two opposite force will be at stake:
          <ul compact>
            <li><b>A higher tax effect:</b> <br>
              If a tax is convex, due to Jensen's inequality, agents with varying income will have a higher tax liability with an annual scheme than with a monthly scheme.
            </li>
            <li><b>An income smoothing effect:</b> <br>
              A concave utility implies that agents want to smooth their consumption between periods. If a tax is monotonously increasing, a monthly tax will have an insurance/income smoothing property that will make agents better off. In other words, people prefer to pay a higher tax when they earn more, and a lower tax when they earn less than to pay always the same tax whatever their income. The "more convex" the tax function is, the higher the income smoothing effect is.
             </li>

          </ul> 
          <p>
          We then run a simulation over the French income tax with monthly data (French Labor Survey) to see which effect dominates. To do so we take an HP Young equal sacrifice utility function derived from the income tax scheme with an inter-temporally separable utility function.

          We find that the monthly scheme is in aggregate better than the annual scheme with an aggregate money metric gain of 2 billion euros.<br>
          The effect is mainly driven by the bottom of the income distribution for three reasons:<br>
          1) Households at the bottom of the income distribution are the ones that face the most yearly variations in income. 2) These households with the lowest income are the ones that are on the steepest part of the utility function and thus weight more in the utilitarian appraisal of the monthly scheme. 3) Income tax brackets are very large and not numerous, thus most households that have small variations of income will face a linear tax scheme, and thus only the income smoothing effect will apply.
        </p>

        <p>
          We then test two other temporal tax system:

        <ul compact>
            <li><b> An equivalized tax scheme</b> that is a monthly tax scheme for which the tax liability is the same than with the annual tax scheme.

              $$\sum_{1}^{T}\frac{1}{T+\lambda}G(Ty_{t})$$
              
             </li>
            <li><b>And an income averaging tax system</b> that follows the tax system proposed by <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/255390?journalCode=jpe">Vickrey (1939)</a> which aims at the tax to be completly neutral (in the amount of money) with respect to the time at which an income is realized.<br>
                $$ {g_{t}^{V}}= \frac{t}{T} G\left(T\frac{\sum_{p=0}^{t}y_{p}}{t}\right) -\sum_{p=0}^{t-1}g_{p}^{V}$$
             </li>
          </ul>

        We show theoretically that both of these tax systems are Pareto improving with respect to the annual and monthly tax system. For increasing income streams the equivalized tax scheme dominates the income averaging scheme, and for decreasing income, the income averaging scheme dominates the equivalized scheme.            
        </p>
        <p>
          With our previous simulations assumptions, we run simulations over these two new income tax scheme. The compensated scheme implies a gain of 500 million euros over the monthly scheme, while the averaging scheme implies a gain of 3 billion euros over the compensated scheme.

        <b>Conclusion:</b> 
          In this article, we give insights on the temporality of the tax which has been relatively unexplored since Vickrey. <br>
          It sheds light 
          We have theoretically, given a static tax scheme, compared several temporal implementations of that scheme. We then have run simulations on the French tax system which exhibit that substantial welfare gains can be obtained compared to the actual tax scheme. Over those tested solutions results favors the proposition that Vickrey made in 19xx. <br>

          Parfit vs. Vickrey

          The domination of the Vickrey scheme (that implies negative income tax if present income is small enough compared to previous periods average income) is partly due to the chosen utility function: H.P Young utility functions asymptotically tend towards \(-\infty\) for a null income. A consequence is that a  demogrant would reduce the money metric gains between the compensated and the averaging scheme. <br>
          However, the compensated scheme lack of an implementation problem: it implies to know future realized income before applying the tax scheme to a specific tax unit.  




    </p>
        <p>To answer that question we are making the assumption that the yearly utility function is inter-temporally additive monthly function increasing in income \(z\): </p>
        $$U = \sum_{t=1}^{12} u(z_t).$$


        We then assume that there exist a tax \(G\), which leads to \(U = \sum_{t=1}^{12} u(z_t - G_t)\).

              <a href="https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/129/4/1553/1853754">Chetty & al(2014)</a> show that intergenerational income mobility is quite small in the US, moreover, they show that intergenerational mobility varies substantially across areas within the United States.
              </p>
              <p>
              France intergenerational mobility has not been subject to many studies.
              <a href="http://www.strategie.gouv.fr/sites/strategie.gouv.fr/files/atoms/files/note-36-geographie-ascension-sociale-ok.pdf">Dherbécourt (2015)</a> looked at the intergenerational mobility over life cycle with respect to socio-professional groups and shows great disparities between regions. However, since the information on parents and children income is missing, it does not allow to do a direct comparison with Chetty & al that rely on inter-quintile income mobility.
              </p>

              <p>
               The Echantillon Demographique Permanent allows to observe over 70 000 children of 17 years old and the income they earn 6 years later. We can also observe their parents income while they live with them.
              </p> 

              <p>
              We can thus look at the relative position in the income distribution of the parents when their child is minor, then look at their children relative position in the income distribution 6 years later where most of them will have finished their studies and will have started to work.
              </p>
              <p>
              The sample being quite large, with very precise geographical information it creates the possibility to investigate geographical intergenerational mobility at least on the county level. 
              </p> 
              
              <P>
              These important descriptive statistics can then lead to a more thorough analysis by looking at the correlation in dimensions developed in Chetty & al. One of the dimensions that I am very interested in is the link between political color, contributions to public goods and social mobility.

                France is facing a decline in its fertility rate since 2014. Fertility, and Tax credits and subsidies related to children has been quite stable from 2006 to 2014. Child per women has decreased from 2 in 2014 to 1.88 in 2018.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> Over the same period, transfers towards households with children have changed: the total transfer per child has been increased for low-income households and decreased for high-income households.

              <p>
                Some commentators of the public debate claim a causal link between the decrease in child tax break and transfers towards high-income households and the global decline in fertility (<a href= "http://www.lefigaro.fr/vox/economie/2019/01/16/31007-20190116ARTFIG00295-comment-le-matraquage-fiscal-et-social-des-familles-a-fait-chuter-la-natalite-francaise.php?fbclid=IwAR00_d2LGT3yaifPtiKQQ71VwFiFgdczhGHa2TNr6jOlBCfEbI9szfPqQ6g">an example</a> -- in French).

                While many studies have indeed found a positive link between tax exemption per dependent children and fertility (<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/2006683.pdf?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents">Whittington & al (1990)</a>, <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0032472031000150066?journalCode=rpst20">Gauthier & al(1997)</a>, <a href="https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/REST_a_00342">Cohen & al (2013)</a>, <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1157260">Laroque Salanie (2008)<a>, <a href="https://www.ntanet.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Bastian_kidsandmarriageEITC_fulldraft-1.pdf"> Bastian(2017)</a>), these studies are usually made on the whole population or focus on the bottom of the income distribution.
                
<!--                 
                Many other explanations can be made on the decline of France fertility (age of women at first child, economic uncertainty, provision of public goods such as creches or schools, etc). -->
              </p>
              <p>
                Does this change in women fertility rate is due to the child tax break and subsidies directed towards high-income households?
                To answer that question we can first rely on a relatively big database (the Échantillon Démographique Permanent) to describe from which part of the income distribution changes in fertility.  We can include as a preliminary analysis the classical determinants of fertility such as the age of the mother at birth, the age of parents relation, number of years of studies, number of previous children, and so on, to see if indeed the decrease in French fertility is due to high-income households.</p>
                <p> If the change in fertility is indeed due to change in high-income households, we can then answer the question if it is due to the reduction in child-related transfers and tax breaks. By relying on three French tax reforms that happened between 2012 and 2015 that reduced widely the tax exemption per dependent children (up to 6% of disposable income for a 3 children family)<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup> only for the last decile of the income distribution. An evaluation of the impact of the reform could be done with a triple-difference estimator as used in the third chapter of my thesis. The Échantillon Démographique Permanent allows running such an analysis in a panel over a relatively large population (over 50 000 households).<br>

            <li>
              <p>Based on the stream of income an individual has, she can, for the same amount of labor income, have different disposable income due to temporal consideration of the tax-benefit system. </p>
<!--               <p> A first example would be the French income benefit (RSA) that is based on the last three month preceding the claim for the benefit and is paid for three months after the claim. A direct consequence is that an individual that works every second month will have a lower disposable income than one that works every second quarter.</p> -->
              <p> A first example would be the French income tax that is based on yearly income. Since it is progressive, a seasonal worker that work every year from October to March will pay a lower tax than an individual that works every second year.</p>


              <p> A second example, a woman that give birth directly after graduating will have no income compensation for the potential loss (or opportunity cost) in labor income, while a woman that has been working for a long enough period will benefit from pre-maternal and maternal leaves.
              </p> 

              <P>In these examples, the labor income earned could be the same over a given period (e.g. life cycle) but can lead to substantive differences in disposable income over that same given period based on the timing of income. <br>
              </P> 
             <!--  <p>
              This rise the question of whether or not it is desirable.
              Vickrey has chosen to defend the point of view that it is not by stating that the same income over the life-cycle should lead to the same disposable income.  </P> -->

              <p> The French tax-benefit system has many complexities that lead to complex disincentives and incentives to work with respect to the timing of labor income interacting with the temporality rule of the tax-benefit system. 
             

              A precise simulation of the tax-benefits (ARE, RSA, PPA, but also in kind local benefits) would allow to simulate agents incentives to work. The use of administrative databases (CNAF data, FH-DADS) would allow seeing how those disincentives generated by the temporality of the tax-benefit system impact agents behavior. If it has an impact, it would be possible to compute the implied deadweight loss of such temporal disincentives to work.</p>

              <p><b>Why is it important?:</b><br>
                Technological advances make unqualified work less important in firms production functions. Labour laws generally encompass a minimum wage that may be above the marginal productivity of the lower-skilled workers, as consequence unemployment is important in many developed countries.
                <br>
                A direct consequence of unemployment is that low skilled workers usually have temporary contracts, that leads to highly volatile labor income.
                </p>
                <p>Tax-benefit systems of the developed country tend to have a regressive tax system when benefits are included, in the sense that the tax is concave at the bottom of the distribution. For instance, individual that earn less than the minimum wage in France face an effective marginal tax rate that is greater than 70%.</p>
                <p>
                  These high marginal tax rates imply a very low incentive to work. A very small cost of job search or a small fixed cost of labor could easily make the expected gain of being active to be negative. Temporal considerations of the tax can increase or reduce these potential disincentives or incentives.
                </p>

                <p>The way we design taxes w.r.t tax temporality would impact thoroughly individuals at the lower end of the income distribution since their income varies a lot (see <a href="#tax_frequency">Tax frequency</a>), and that taxes represent a very significant share of their disposable income.

                <p>
                 <p><b>Normative considerations:</b><br> 
                <p>
                Luck egalitarianism being an appealing normative argument stating that individuals should be as well off independently of their unchose circumstances. Unemployment and temporary contracts are de-facto creating inequalities between individuals that are equally responsible for their situations. Thus a large part of the variation that the bottom of the income distribution faces can be considered as <b>brute luck</b>.
              </p>

              <p>
                A solution to reduce the impact of taxation would be to use 
                <!-- <a href="./normative_tax_temporality_axioms.html"> </a>-->temporally neutral tax systems. For instance, Vickrey's tax system would be quite suitable.<br>
                However, Vickrey's tax system would allow to do not respect the imperative that a tax should be paid by its citizen "in proportion to their respective abilities", allowing very productive individuals to work on a very small period of their lifetime by facing a very small tax.

          </h4>
          <ul compact>
            <li>



<p>
The rise of employment precariousness in developed countries, especially at the bottom of the income distribution, is logically associated with an increase in short-term labor income variations. 
</p>
<p>
Infra-annual income variation of households is subject to very few studies in the economic literature.  Hills (2006) shows that the very bottom of the distribution is the one that has the largest income variations within the year. They also show that the bottom of the distribution barely save, and usually just cope with their disposable income for a given month.
On another hand, taxes and benefits are linked with the timing of events, such as income realization, unemployment, pregnancy, etc.
</p>

<p>
Policy evaluations of the tax benefit system through microsimulation, but also optimal taxation models assume that individuals have steady incomes. A first issue, since tax-benefit schemes are not linear,  can lead to radical differences between static simulations of tax and benefits throughout the year with a steady income, and the one households are really entitled to. 
</p>

<p>
A second one is that optimal taxation models solutions are not valid anymore if we introduce within year income variations. 
</p> 
<p>
Moreover, this could make some benefits to create poverty traps that would not be observable with a static framework. Indeed the incentives usually based on a "work must pay" normative statement may not always hold when varying hours of work are introduced. 
<p>
Vickrey (1939) proposed a potential solution for such issues that is based on income averaging over the life cycle. His proposition was that at each period of the life cycle, the cumulative tax paid is the one that one would have had to pay if its income were steady since the beginning of her life.
</p> 
<p>
Vickrey's solution has very appealing features. Indeed if one has a low income at the beginning of her life, but then has later a positive productivity shock that leads to the possibility to earn a high income, the marginal income tax she will face would be low and will thus have desirable incentivizing properties. Conversely if one has a high income at the beginning of her life, but then has a negative productivity shock, she will receive negative tax transfers for multiple periods.
</p>
<p>
Obviously, there is no such thing as a free lunch, and Vickrey's solution comes with two major drawbacks. The first one is the other face of the coin of the preceding paragraph: if a high skill worker has a life accident that reduces her skill, she will face a very high marginal tax rate that in conjunction to the negative income tax she will get would lead her to do not work. (and it might lead to a potential deadweight loss of the tax greater than the one that one would have paid in the presence of an annual tax with a progressive scheme).
</p> 
<p>
Another one concerns the normative statement that for a given income over the life cycle, one should pay the same tax whatever the timing of the income. The justification for a progressive tax scheme is normatively based on one ability to contribute. If one ability to contribute is very high at a given period, it can be viewed as fair that the burden of the tax is higher on the given period. 
</p>


<p>
Vickrey's solution, however, does not take into account the responsibility of the tax-payer 
</p>  


 

<p>
The first task would be to document by making tests cases of different temporal situations with OpenFisca to document which cases violate the "work must pay" condition, but also document the actual incentives to work with respect to the timing of events. This would include national tax and benefits, but also local benefits (in money or in-kind). The analysis will be conducted for France, for localities for which local transfers has been coded (Paris, Le Mans, etc).

Once the best timing sequences have been correctly documented, it is possible, by using databases that contains infra-annual information on individuals income to what extent they are sensitive to the associated incentives. (Leila article chomage) Evaluate the induced deadweight loss of bad temporality (reference steady income).

Then, based on the risk that is inherent to being in a specific position of the income distribution, it is possible to derive 
</p> 



 








For instance, if an individual face a risk on its future employment status (that could be independent of her will)

        Many studies have found a positive link between tax exemption per dependent children and fertility (<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/2006683.pdf?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents">Whittington & al (1990)</a>, <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0032472031000150066?journalCode=rpst20">Gauthier & al(1997)</a>, <a href="https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/REST_a_00342">Cohen & al (2013)</a>, <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1157260">Laroque Salanie (2008)<a>, <a href="https://www.ntanet.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Bastian_kidsandmarriageEITC_fulldraft-1.pdf"> Bastian(2017)</a>) suggesting that children are normal goods. However, these studies are usually made on the whole population or focus on the bottom of the income distribution.

      Proponents of child tax break increasing with income  may argue on the possibility that, by incentivizing rich households to have more children may endogenously increase future growth through better human capital. -->
      <!-- <p>
        Indeed top of the income distribution parents tend to make their children inherit of their good social, and intellectual capital.
        They also invest more in their education. This would generally lead to more productive children.
        By subsidizing rich households fertility government may create future economic growth when their high-skilled children will enter the labor market.

        Although this reasoning can be questioned ethically,
        the government would then face a classical equity/efficiency tradeoff: by giving to rich households, the government entails the equity principle by giving more to those that are not in needs. But by incentivizing rich households to have children it may endogenously increase future growth through better human capital.

        As child tax break positively linked with income being generalized in developed countries, the consequences and normatives choices implied needs to be analysed. 
        
        
        this debate is of interest to the condition that rich households do react to fertility incentives.
